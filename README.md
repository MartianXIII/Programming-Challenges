# Programming Challenges

**A collection of programming challenges and their outcomes in various 
languages.**

This repository contains:
 * A list of programming challenges, identified by categories and names.
 * A wiki, with hints for the challenges.
 * Completed challenges, sorted by language.

## Contributing
If you wish to add a challenge, place it in the right category in the 
`challenges` folder and add a wiki page to it. Then send me a pull request
so I can add your challenge!

Completed challenges can be placed in the `completed-challenges` folder. 
If you can't find your language there, make a folder for it. The name of
your file should correspond with the name of the challenge. A challenge
called "random number generator" should be called `random-number-generator`.
