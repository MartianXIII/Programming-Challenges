# Contributing
Completed a challenge? Great! Please ensure it *really* follows the 
challenge rules, and then add it to the repo.

First, create a directory for your language, if it doesn't exist yet. 
Example: `completed-challenges/php`. Then, add a folder for the 
challenge, if it doesn't exist yet. Also include the category. For 
example: `completed-challenges/php/games/sudoku`. Now, create a 
directory with your username, and place any relevant files for your 
solution in that directory. Your final directory will be something like 
`completed-challenges/php/games/sudoku/yourname`, with the file 
`sudoku.php` and `grid.png`.
